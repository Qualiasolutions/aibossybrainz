								Alecci Media LLC (&quot;we&quot;, &quot;us&quot;, or &quot;our&quot;) is committed to protecting your privacy. We offer subscribers access to the Alecci Media Bots (the &quot;Bot&quot;), which are made available across multiple platforms and have strategic marketing and sales information and capabilities (the &quot;Services&quot;), as well as other information and services we may provide. We have prepared this Privacy Policy (&quot;Privacy Policy&quot;) to describe to you our practices regarding the information that we collect from subscribers and the Services we offer.
							</p>
							<p>
								We are committed to complying with the Children&apos;s Online Protection Act of 1998 (&quot;COPPA&quot;). COPPA requires that we obtain parental consent before we allow children under the age of 13 to access and/or use our Services. We urge children to check with their parents before entering information through our Site and/or Services, and we recommend that parents discuss with their children restrictions regarding the online release of personal information to anyone they do not know.
							</p>
							<p>
								By using our Bot and/or Services, or by permitting your child to use our Services, you are agreeing to the terms of this Privacy Policy and the accompanying Alecci Media Terms of Service (the &quot;Terms&quot;), which are incorporated herein.
							</p>

							<h2>Information Collected</h2>
							<h3>Information You Provide to Us</h3>
							<p>
								When you utilize our Bot or Services, you may be prompted to provide personal information.

							<p>
								We retain information on your behalf, including the content of the message and the recipient data, using your information. We will not use the raw text of conversations for training unless explicit consent is obtained.
							</p>
							<p>
								We may use anonymized, aggregated analytics data to improve the Bot.
							</p>
							<p>
								We may also collect personal information at other points in our Services that state that personal information is being collected.

You may set your device settings to refuse cookies or to remove cookies from your hard drive, but our Site does not recognize &quot;Do Not Track&quot; signals.
