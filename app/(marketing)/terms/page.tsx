              <p>
                These Terms will be governed by the laws of the State of Arizona
                without giving effect to any conflict of law principles that may
                require the application of the law of another jurisdiction.
              </p>

              <h3>Disputes</h3>
              <p>
                Any dispute relating in any way to your visit to or use of the
                Bot, to the Services you purchase through the Bot, or to your
                relationship with us will be submitted to confidential
                arbitration in Arizona. You hereby consent to and waive all
                defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction and forum non
                conveniens with respect to venue and jurisdiction in the state
                and federal courts of Arizona. Arbitration under these Terms
                will be conducted pursuant to the Commercial Arbitration Rules
                then prevailing at the American Arbitration Association. The
                arbitrator&apos;s award will be final and binding and may be
                entered into as a judgment in any court of competent
                jurisdiction. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law,
                no arbitration under these Terms will be joined to an
                arbitration involving any other party subject to these Terms,

                  contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of, related
                  to, or connected with the use of this Bot or these Terms must
                  be filed within one (1) year after such claim of action arose

              <h3>Modifications to Terms</h3>
              <p>
                We may change these Terms from time to time. Any such changes
                will become effective upon the earlier of thirty (30) calendar
                days following our dispatch of an e-mail notice to you (if
                applicable) or thirty (30) calendar days following our posting
                of notice of the changes on our Bot. These changes will be
                effective immediately for new users of our Bot or Services. If
                you object to any such changes, your sole recourse will be to
                cease using the Bot and the Services. Continued use of the Bot
                or the Services following posting of any such changes will
                indicate your acknowledgement of such changes and your agreement

              </p>

              <h3>Waiver; Remedies</h3>
              <p>
                The failure of us to, partially or fully, exercise any rights or
                the waiver of any breach of these Terms of Service by you will
                not prevent a subsequent exercise of such right by us or be
                deemed a waiver by us of any subsequent breach by you of the
                same or any other term of these Terms. The rights and remedies
                of us under these Terms and any other applicable agreement
                between you and us will be cumulative, and the exercise of any
                such right or remedy will not limit our right to exercise any
                other right or remedy.
